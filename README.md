# AdventOfCode2022
Advent of Code is a yearly programming event where small, two part puzzles are uploaded daily from
December 1st to December 25th (like an Advent calendar!). The event was created and is maintained by Eric Wastl, check out the website [here](https://adventofcode.com)! <br/>

I am working my way backwards through AoC to learn new languages. For 2022 I am trying c++, wish me luck!
